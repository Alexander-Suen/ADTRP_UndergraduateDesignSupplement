## ADTRP/AIG Gene Family Phylogenetic Analysis Repository
This repository contains the code and data for conducting a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the ADTRP/AIG gene family. The ADTRP/AIG gene family, composed of ADTRP, AIG1, and AIG-L genes, plays crucial roles in various physiological processes and has implications in numerous diseases. Understanding the evolutionary relationships and functional implications of these genes is essential for unraveling their biological significance.

## Repository Contents
data/: This directory contains the input data used for phylogenetic analysis, including gene sequences and related information.
scripts/: Here, you will find the scripts used for data preprocessing, multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree construction, and statistical analysis.
results/: The output files from the analysis, including phylogenetic trees, statistical metrics, and visualizations, are stored in this directory.

## Analysis Workflow
Data Preprocessing: Gene sequences from representative species were collected and organized in a suitable format for subsequent analysis. Information regarding species taxonomy and gene annotations was also incorporated.
Multiple Sequence Alignment: The gene sequences were aligned using state-of-the-art alignment algorithms to ensure accurate positioning of homologous regions.
Phylogenetic Tree Construction: Phylogenetic trees were inferred using both maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods. ML approaches such as RAxML-NG and IQ-tree were employed, along with Bayesian methods implemented in MrBayes.
Statistical Analysis: Statistical metrics, including bootstrap values and Bayesian posterior probabilities, were calculated to assess the reliability and support of the inferred phylogenetic relationships.
Visualization: The resulting phylogenetic trees and related visualizations were generated to facilitate the interpretation and communication of the analysis results.
## Usage
To reproduce the phylogenetic analysis or explore the results, follow the instructions provided in the individual script files. The necessary input data can be found in the data/ directory, while the output files generated during the analysis are stored in the results/ directory.
